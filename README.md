# A smart, interactive desktop companion that reacts to its environment, displaying emotions and behaviors through an OLED screen, RGB LED, and sound effects.

This project is an ongoing development of a desktop AI pet designed to interact with its environment in a delightful and intelligent way. Currently, the pet displays a range of emotions and makes sounds, going to sleep when it detects darkness and showing a happy face with a joyful sound when touched. It also has the capability to display the current time, adding a practical element to its charm.

The project is still in progress, with plans to design an appropriate enclosure that will both protect the components and complement its role as a desktop companion. Future enhancements include integrating weather data into its responses and completing the RGB LED feature, which will add another layer of expressiveness to the pet.

In the final stages, there's an ambitious goal to incorporate an AI model, possibly using TinyML, to give the pet even more advanced and personalized behaviors. While it's uncertain how much of this will be possible, the potential for creating a truly intelligent and responsive desktop companion is both exciting and promising.

Feel free for suggestions to add or modify anything based on your vision for the project!
